# Memory
Memory Card Game
Instructions:

To start the memory game, run 'python3 memory.py' on the terminal with Python 3
installed. The 16 alphabet letters represent 16 cards. Entering a letter will
flip the corresponding card. Find two matching cards with the same symbol.


The cards are stored in a list. Each alphabet used by the user to refer to each
card is mapped to the index of the card in a dictionary. The number of flips is
tracked in the flips variable to tell the user at the end of the game.
